ðŸ§­ Why CollegeBuddy?
Modern campuses are noisy online but lonely offline. New and transfer students struggle to discover friends with overlapping interests, schedules, or classes. General-purpose social networks arenâ€™t built for campus trust, while traditional forums lack real-time connection and safety controls.
CollegeBuddy narrows the scope to verified students, prioritizing small, meaningful connections (grab lunch, study together, join a club) over broad, follower-style feeds.

 CollegeBuddy is being built by students for students.
